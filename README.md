# Surgical-Risk-Calculator-SURF

This project is a summer research project at the California Institute of Technology that uses the ACS NSQIP 2016, 2017, and 2018 datasets found at https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/acs-nsqip. It provides R scripts to process this data and generate validation material for it. I am currently working towards reproducing the [NSQIP risk calculator](https://riskcalculator.facs.org/RiskCalculator/) and eventually trying to improve upon it by using a tree-bsaed model.
